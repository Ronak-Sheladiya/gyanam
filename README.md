Of course. Here are the requirements and commands to run your PDF Q&A application from scratch.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python: Version 3.8 or newer.

Ollama: You must have the Ollama application installed and running locally. You can download it from ollama.com.

Step 1: Set Up Your Project
First, organize your files.

Create a new folder for your project and navigate into it:

Bash

mkdir pdf_qa_app
cd pdf_qa_app
Create a file named app.py and paste your Python code into it.

Create a file named requirements.txt in the same folder and add the following lines to it. This file lists all the necessary Python libraries.

Plaintext

streamlit
langchain
langchain-community
langchain-ollama
faiss-cpu
pypdf
Your project folder should now look like this:

pdf_qa_app/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
Step 2: Install Python Packages
It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

Create and activate a virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:

Bash

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required libraries using the requirements.txt file:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Download Ollama Models
Your code requires two specific models from Ollama. Open your terminal and run the following commands to download them. Make sure the Ollama application is running before you do this.

Download the embedding model:

Bash

ollama pull nomic-embed-text
Download the LLM:

Bash

ollama pull gemma:2b
Step 4: Run the Streamlit App
Now you're ready to launch the application. Run the following command in your terminal from the project directory (pdf_qa_app).

Bash

streamlit run app.py
This command will start the Streamlit server, and your PDF Q&A application should open automatically in a new web browser tab. You can now upload your PDF files and start asking questions. ðŸš€
